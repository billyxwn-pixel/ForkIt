## 5. Known bugs and limitations
* - Bugs:
* None discovered yet.

* - Limitations:
* Currently hard-coded to show a restaurant is open now even if it isn't. Code needs to be adjusted to determine if the current time is within the current day's business hours for a restaurant and change the string accordingly.

## 6. Features and improvements for the future
What we'd like to build in the future:
* Integrate Google Maps better, so the Open Maps button on a restaurant's page can link and provide directions right away without any more input from the user.
* A more fleshed-out profile function, so the user can upload pictures and put in more information about themselves.
* A way for users to specify they are a business owner, and let them put their business details into the database.
* A cleanup on the Firestore database to reduce redundancies and prepare for a larger-scale deployment.
